MatrixEmu - an emulation of the scrolling console text in 'the Matrix'

*** What Works ***
Currently, we have scrolling text columns. These columns descend at variable
rates and have variable lengths. It is easy to add new columns. Columns are 
automatically culled from the active column linked list when they are found to
be offscreen after moving down.

*** To Do ***
Work on getting support for different colors of text. We'll be able to have the
columns fade from bright green to black smoothly over their length. Column
motion will be much easier to observe with color transitions.
